# Python wrapper for the Deditec RO-Modules (RO-USB and RO-ETH)

## Gives a convenient access to the Deditec RO-Series. (Windows/LINUX)
+ now supporting Debian GNU/Linux - Ubuntu 22.04 and 24.04 with shared so-library!
+ unpack the zip-file and put at correct location of the driver samples location.
+ copy 'delib_eth_so' in the right directory (see wrapper)
+ a c-file compliles the so-file with gcc. See inside the file...


> [!TIP]
> From the defined constants you can estimate the wrappers' capabilities... Have fun!
